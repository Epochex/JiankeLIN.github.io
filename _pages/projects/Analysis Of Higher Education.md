# Analysis of Higher Education Based on DEA-CCR and TOPSIS
## Description

Conducted comprehensive analysis of higher education in the Yangtze River Delta region, utilizing **DEA-CCR** for input-output assessment and created a **TOPSIS** model with **entropy weight method**. Applied advanced techniques, including **Monte Carlo simulation**, **Tobit factor analysis**, and **ARIMA time series forecasting**.

## Abstract

Promoting the development of higher education fosters the growth of social culture and technological advancements. To maintain and promote the development of higher education in the Yangtze River Delta region, this paper, grounded in reality and through consulting various literatures and employing statistical methods, analyzes the rankings and current state of higher education in the region, forecasts future developments, and offers suggestions for future development plans.

- **Question 1**: Among the numerous universities in the Yangtze River Delta region, rank the top twenty universities in terms of strength.

- **Question 2**: Referencing the 2021 college entrance examination (Gaokao) application rules of Zhejiang Province and the enrollment plans of related universities, devise a preliminary school and major application plan for Xiao Li's brother, and analyze the rationality of this plan.

- **Question 3**: During the process of formulating the application plan, it is discovered that the distribution of higher education resources in the Yangtze River Delta region is unbalanced. Please conduct a quantitative analysis of the current state of higher education development in the Yangtze River Delta region and explore the factors influencing the development of higher education.

- **Question 4**: Forecast the development of higher education in the Yangtze River Delta region for the next five years and beyond, and propose reasonable suggestions for the future development planning of higher education in the Yangtze River Delta region.

For question one, the study selects the top twenty universities in the Yangtze River Delta region based on their strength. Taking into account real-world factors, the study establishes a **comprehensive capability evaluation system** for universities in three major aspects: talent cultivation, scientific research, and social service. The data on the quality of talent cultivation comes from the admission scores of various universities' majors, employment rates, and further study rates of graduates; the index data of research achievements are measured by the total number of citations of papers authored by individuals from a university obtained from the CNKI database; the data on social service capability comes from employer satisfaction with universities posted on job websites. By **mining asynchronous crawler data** and standardizing the data, the study establishes a **TOPSIS** model based on the **entropy weight method** to solve and identify the top twenty strongest universities, with Zhejiang University ranking first, Shanghai Jiao Tong University second, and Fudan University third.

For question two, based on the 2021 Zhejiang college entrance examination application rules and the enrollment plans of various universities, a college application plan is formulated for Xiao Li's brother. Assuming Xiao Li's brother's college entrance examination score is estimated to be in the top 10% of the province this year, with interests in intelligent cars and drones, and considering the family's preference for universities closer to home, a needs analysis is conducted. Using data mining techniques to gather data on six indicators: interest, distance from home, professional salary, subject evaluation, professional score, and city development. Due to the unknown total number of college entrance examination candidates and admission ranks of each specialty in 2022, **grey forecasting methods** are used. Considering Xiao Li's brother's personal needs and actual situation, the model considers the requirements of chosen courses as decision variables, with the estimated rank and course suitability as constraints. A **multi-objective planning model** for college entrance examination application is established, using the **Monte Carlo simulation** method to simulate Xiao Li's brother's 80 college entrance exams. The simulation results are combined to solve the multi-objective planning model, yielding a preliminary college application plan for Xiao Ming, with the first choice being the Information Security major at Hefei University of Technology.

For question three, focusing on Zhejiang Province**, Anhui Province**, Jiangsu Province, and Shanghai as the main areas of analysis, the study first obtains basic indicators for a comprehensive evaluation of higher education development levels from the literature. To minimize the influence of inter-indicator correlation on the results, **principal component analysis** is used to reduce dimensions, retaining five principal components: general teaching staff, senior teaching staff, living fixed assets, research fixed assets, and education funding, as input indicators for higher education. With undergraduate and graduate training numbers, SCI paper publications, and technology transfer as output indicators of higher education, a **DEA-CCR** model for evaluating the current state of higher education development is established. The analysis finds that Zhejiang Province has a relatively complete higher education system, while Anhui Province lags behind. For the sub-question, considering factors such as population size, policy support, economic strength, industrial structure, faculty quality, and scientific and technological development as potential influencers of higher education development in the Yangtze River Delta region, the **Tobit model** is used to analyze the main factors affecting higher education, finding population size and policy support as significant influencers.

For question four, using the model established in question three, the comprehensive efficiency of higher education in the four provinces and cities over the past fifteen years is calculated. A **time series prediction model** is established to forecast the comprehensive efficiency of higher education in the four provinces for the next five years. The forecast shows that Zhejiang Province, Shanghai, and Jiangsu Province will maintain stable development in higher education over the next five years, while Anhui Province shows a declining trend, necessitating increased attention. Based on the forecast results, the following suggestions are made for the future development of higher education in the Yangtze River Delta region: accelerate the reform of higher education resource allocation in the Yangtze River Delta region, vigorously promote the integration of higher education resources, deepen the reform of the education evaluation system, and strengthen the intrinsic development of higher education.
